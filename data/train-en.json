One model, known as Turing machine, proposed the construction of a universal machine capable of operating with a sequence of instructions and data intermixed on a tape of infinite length; the machine could operate on a point on the tape at a time using a head for reading and writing, so running the program that you are last. Another model is based on recursive composite functions to operate directly on the numbers. A similar approach is the lambda calculus. Another class of approaches works with grammar rules operating on strings, as in the case of Markov chains and Post systems."}, {"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "electronic computers", "answer_start": 277}, {"text": "electronic computers, provided there is no memory constraints involved", "answer_start": 277}, {"text": "to electronic computers, provided there is no memory constraints involved", "answer_start": 273}], "question": "The proposed models are equivalent to what?", "id": "f2ccd205ac284d239c3da37353f84196"}, {"answers": [{"text": "computability theory", "answer_start": 698}, {"text": "computability theory", "answer_start": 698}, {"text": "computability theory", "answer_start": 698}], "question": "What theory investigates issues relating to the possibility of carrying out certain types of computing certain types of machine?", "id": "fe050a7c0ff4410aa43a1b656a70f58f"}], "context": "All formalisms above are equivalent in terms of computing power, ie, any computation that can be performed with a model can be performed with any of the other models.

For many years nothing was known about this machine, therefore, attributed to Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) the construction of the first calculating machine, which was only additions and subtractions. Pascal machine was created in order to help his father to compute taxes in Rouen, France.
