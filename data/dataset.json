The United States Navy, in conjunction with Harvard University, developed the Harvard Mark I computer, designed by Professor Howard Aiken, based on Babbage&#39;s analytical calculator. The Mark I occupied approximately 120m\u00b3, managing to multiply two ten-digit numbers in three seconds. Simultaneously, and in secret, the United States Army was developing a similar project, led by engineers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the result of which was the first valve computer, the Electronic Numeric Integrator And Calculator (ENIAC), capable of making five hundred multiplications per second.
