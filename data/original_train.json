In your system, ones and zeros also represent concepts such as true and false, on and off, valid and invalid. More than a century later, George Boole published Boolean algebra (in 1854), with a complete system that allowed the construction of mathematical models for computational processing. In 1801, the loom controlled by perforated cardboard appeared, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard, in which holes indicated ones and, unpunched areas, indicated zeros.

The professionals generate software (programs) that run on hardware (equipment) operated by users (individuals), prepared and trained in standard operating procedures, endowed with knowledge of the software and hardware for their work. Since then the systems analysis is a profession whose responsibilities focus on system analysis and management of computer systems.
